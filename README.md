## üé® Customization

You can easily adapt this template for your own use:

  - **Text:** Edit the text content directly in the `index.html` file within the `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<h2>` tags.
  - **Images:** Replace the image URLs in the `<img>` tags with your own. The key images are the logo, the main banner, and the two product images in the two-column section.
  - **Colors & Fonts:** All styles are located within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` of the `index.html` file. You can change colors, font sizes, and spacing by modifying the CSS rules. For example, to change the main background color, modify the `body` selector:
    ```css
    body {
        background-color: rgb(r, g, b);
    }
    ```
